Abacus is a toolkit for defining and recording game metrics during playtesting sessions.  It exports a JSON file after a playtesting session containing all of the recorded data, which can be visualized with Abacus Board.  Abacus can be integrated into a Unity project with little to no coupling and removed just as easily for production builds.

## Getting Started
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/nmacadam/Abacus/releases) and head over to the [documentation](https://www.notion.so/Abacus-Playtesting-Metrics-1fd8efa230824700bf989c6ab67cbdf5) for an introduction to the Abacus toolset.

## Feature Overview

### üßæ Generic Value Recording
Abacus can periodically record generic type values throughout gameplay.  This is accomplished completely nonintrusively with a Metric component.  No calls like 'Abacus.RecordValue(myValue)' required--it's handled automatically!  The default time step for recording values can be globally adjusted, or a custom time step can be assigned to each Metric.  Creating a new Metric recorder is simple, either inherit from FieldMetric<> to read from fields, or PropertyMetric<> to read from properties.

### ‚è± Temporal Recording
Abacus provides several means to record temporal data about gameplay.  These components do require a call to record but are built to easily integrate into your project's event system.
- Timestamps (mark a time with a string and save it)
- Stopwatch (single event, multiple durations for comparison)
- Splitwatch (seperate, sequential events for an event timeline)

### üìã Abacus Board Data Visualization App
Abacus Board is an accessory app that visualizes data and generates statistics from the Abacus plugin output file.  Check out its [repository](https://github.com/nmacadam/abacus-board) or [see it in action](https://nmacadam.github.io/abacus-board/).

## Roadmap
- Customization settings for intermediate value dumping
- Scene-Agnostic recorders
- Cumulative metrics for multiple sessions
- Screenshot support
- Raw data output types (.csv, etc.)

### Dependencies
- Json.NET for Unity
- NSubstitute (only for tests)

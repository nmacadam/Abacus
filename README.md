# üßÆ Abacus
 Playtesting metrics toolkit for Unity

## Features
### üßæ Generic Value Recording
Abacus can periodically record generic type values throughout gameplay.  This is accomplished completely nonintrusively with a Metric component.  No calls like 'Abacus.RecordValue(myValue)' required!  The default time step for recording values can be globally adjusted, or a custom time step can be assigned to each Metric.

### ‚è± Temporal Recording
Abacus provides several means to record temporal data about gameplay.
- Timestamps (mark a time with a string and save it)
- Stopwatch (single event, multiple durations for comparison)
- Splitwatch (seperate, sequential events for an event timeline)

## Upcoming Features
- Data output to JSON
- Preemptive value dumping (for minimizing necessary memory)
- Cumulative metrics for multiple sessions
- Screenshot support
- Triggerable metric recording
- Browser based data visualization
